# ics2csv

This code is meant to convert .ics calendar files (from google calendar) into a .CSV format. At the moment, calendar metadata is discarded.

I've found a few websites that will do this for you, but I'd rather just do it myself without handing over personal information. Hopefully someone else also finds this helpful. Let me know if you use it!
